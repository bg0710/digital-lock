# digital-lock
It is an Arduino-based project, I have used an Arduino UNO R3 board along with a 16x2 LCD display and a 4x4Keypad(4x3 preferred).
The Arduino code for this project has been posted in my repository along with the Schematic diagram of the circuit.

Set your PIN once, and you are all set to use your digital lock in any of your circuits

You can refer to My Tinkercad circuit for reference
